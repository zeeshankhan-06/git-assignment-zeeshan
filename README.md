# GitHub & Git Assignment 
## What I Learned from the video

* **git add**: Moves specific changes to the "staging area" to prepare them for a commit.
* **git commit**: Creates a permanent snapshot of your staged changes in the project history.
* **branching**: Creates a separate environment to develop and test new features without affecting the main code.
